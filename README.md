This project takes heavy inspiration from [@wazho](https://github.com/wazho)'s
[ns-joycon](https://github.com/wazho/ns-joycon),
which in turn is based on [@dekuNukem](https://github.com/dekuNukem)'s
[Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering](https://github.com/dekuNukem/Nintendo_Switch_Reverse_Engineering).
The rumble code was contributed by
[@baku89](https://github.com/baku89).
The [HVC-Controller](https://twitter.com/taisukef/status/1572349705828569092) code was added by [@taisukef](https://github.com/taisukef).
The [Ring-Con](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_Fit_Adventure) code from [@mascii](https://github.com/mascii/demo-of-ring-con-with-web-hid).
